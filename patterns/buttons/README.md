The buttons use the primary colour to match the rest of the website's aesthetic.

- The regular buttons are to be used on light backgrounds, which remains consistent with the whole website, while being bold enough to identify as a call-to-action
- The light buttons are only to be used on a dark background in place of the regular button.
- The ghost button is for call-to-actions on forms, card, checkout
