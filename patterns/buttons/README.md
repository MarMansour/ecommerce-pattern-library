The buttons use the primary colour to match the rest of the website's aesthetic.

- The standard buttons can be used on all backgrounds, creating consistency within the whole website, while being bold enough to identify as a call-to-action
- The action buttons are only to be used for important call-to-actions. To be used on a light background.
- The light button is an alternative call-to-action button to be used only when a dark background is the only option.
