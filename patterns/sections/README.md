Various sections can be used to make the text content more approachable

- The text-image section is to be used to display text beside an image. This text is to be complimentary to the image and can be treated as a direct caption to the image, or be vaguely referring to the content in the image.
- Text sections are to only contain text, no images. This is to be used for large sections of text.
